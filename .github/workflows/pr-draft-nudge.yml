###
# This workflow nudges users to mark their pull requests as draft if they are not ready for review.
#
# To disable the comment, set the `PR_DRAFT_NUDGE_COMMENT_DISABLE` variable in the repository settings to `true`.
# The default value is `false`, which means the comment will be posted.
# To set the variable, you can use the GitHub CLI:
#   gh variable set PR_DRAFT_NUDGE_COMMENT_DISABLE --body "true"
